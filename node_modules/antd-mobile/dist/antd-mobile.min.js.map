The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n\t * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n\t * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n\t * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n\t * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n\t * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n\t * invocation.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n\t * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n\t * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t *\n\t * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n\t * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n\t *\n\t * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n\t * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @since 0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n\t * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n\t * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n\t * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n\t *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n\t * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n\t *\n\t * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n\t * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n\t *   'leading': true,\n\t *   'trailing': false\n\t * }));\n\t *\n\t * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n\t * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n\t * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n\t * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n\t *\n\t * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n\t */\n\tfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n\t  var lastArgs,\n\t      lastThis,\n\t      maxWait,\n\t      result,\n\t      timerId,\n\t      lastCallTime,\n\t      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n\t      leading = false,\n\t      maxing = false,\n\t      trailing = true;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t  }\n\t  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n\t  if (isObject(options)) {\n\t    leading = !!options.leading;\n\t    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n\t    maxWait = maxing ?

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n\t * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n\t * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n\t * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n\t *\n\t * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n\t * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n\t * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n\t * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n\t * whether to re-render it or not.\n\t *\n\t * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n\t * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n\t * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n\t * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n\t * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n\t * it.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * getInitialState: function() {\n\t *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n\t *   return {ds};\n\t * },\n\t * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n\t *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n\t *   this.setState({\n\t *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n\t *   });\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n\t   * headers and rows.

The only way\n\t * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n\t * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n\t *\n\t * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n\t * necessary\n\t *\n\t * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n\t * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n\t * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n\t * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n\t *\n\t * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n\t * interaction, and scrolling (among others).

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nvar ListViewDataSource = function () {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.
